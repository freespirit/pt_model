# About
This is a simple ML computer vision model. It's a part of a machine learning playground that downloads photos from a 3rd party source, stores them here and then builds dataset for computer vision tasks. The structure of the project is microservices-like so this is just one part.



# Model
The first version of the model would be  a custom ResNet implementation that uses
pre-trained Imagenet weights.

* an official [`TF-slim`](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim) model could be useful
